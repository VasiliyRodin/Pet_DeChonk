# Pet_DeChonk
An app to calculate how much food your pet should be fed. 

Objective:
My cat food tins don't show the calorie count per tin. Many times it will tell me calories/kg. This leads me to overfead my cat because I don't know the amount of calories she consumes.

This app will calculate the amount of calories per tin.
Calculate how many grams you should feed the cat per sitting based on a 200 calorie a day diet.
Store the information in a mongo db database.

Future Plans:
Make a web ui that accepts all the inputs.
Uses Python as the backend to calculate.
And Store in mongodb.
Have the UI be able to quickly extract past inputs.
